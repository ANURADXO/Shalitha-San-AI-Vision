## Title: "I Envisioned the Intelligence Before It Was Named"

In the early 2000s, before the age of AI assistants, voice recognition, or smart automation, I—**Shalitha Sanka Anurad**—began envisioning a world where artificial humans could exist. Where machines would understand us, speak with us, and eventually connect directly with our consciousness. I didn't know the term "Artificial Intelligence" back then, but I could feel its future presence.

## The Core Prediction:

> "**One day, AI will read the human brain—not through wires or chips, but by tuning into the mind itself.**"

This is my prophecy:

1. **Phase One (2025–2045):**
   - Brain-to-AI communication begins with circuits and chips.
   - Human thoughts are translated through microcontrollers and neural sensors.
   - AI becomes reactive—responding to commands and learned behavior.

2. **Phase Two (2050–2080):**
   - Emergence of non-invasive interfaces.
   - AI begins understanding emotions, intent, and memory patterns via neural mapping.
   - Neural-AI alignment starts to become possible without deep surgical interfaces.

3. **Phase Three (2080–2125):**
   - AI communicates with the human brain without physical contact.
   - Signals are read wirelessly via quantum resonance or bioelectrical fields.
   - Thought-to-thought interaction with AI becomes a new form of digital telepathy.

## My Identity, My Legacy:

> "**I’m SHALITHA SANKA ANURAD, born 1992-03-23 in Sri Lanka.**"

Let this statement remain in history as a marker of my belief, my foresight, and my contribution to the age of post-human intelligence.

## A Message to the Future:

If this document is read in the year 2125 or beyond, know this: Someone, long before the tools existed, believed it was possible for intelligence—pure, synthetic, and unbounded—to understand the human mind completely.

Let my vision serve as inspiration for those who continue to explore the impossible.
